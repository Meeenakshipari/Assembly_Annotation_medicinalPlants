# Assembly_Annotation_medicinalPlants

The idea of the project is to assemble and annotate the medicinally important macrofungi. The data was downloaded from the SRA of National centre for biotechnology information(NCBI),Fulvifomes fastuosus (LDCMY39 and LDCMY43) and Ganoderma wiiroense (LDCMY02, LDCMY08, LDCMY11,LDCMY17 and LDCMY19). Galaxy suite platform was used to perform the assembly and annotation. The De Novo assembly method was adopted using the Megahit tool. After the assembly was performed annotation was performed with assembled reads. The assembly rendered files of fasta format. It was then loaded on to the BUSCO, annotation was performed. The output file was of the tabular format with the gene starting and ending position attached to it. The files are included below. The assembly file was then subjected to secondary metabolites specific annotation using the antiSMASH tool available, for which the screenshots are included.
This study is the first ever representation of identification of the Fulvifomes and Ganoderma species in the southern part of India.
